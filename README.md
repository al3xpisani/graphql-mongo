graphql-mongo

API Rest works like indicated with get (query data) , post to create resources,
Put to change resources and delete.

GraphQL works like a sql syntax but instead it posts one only call (post) where you use
A json query to return data or change or delete.

The advantages is only one requisition (rest) is made and teh controls stays only in the front
End side.

Lets suppose we have one backend attending for web and mobile.
I can work with graphql to send data to backend exactly that data I need only. Avoiding unecessary
Data flowing thru requisitions.
